## Run Script ##
################

# This script runs the VerbNet VxC application in the semlink-java project.
#
# This script has a hard-coded path to the compiled code so
# it is meant to point to the shared deployment and symbolic
# links can be used to point to this script.
#
# Below is an example usage of VxC.  There are many parameters
# to supply to the VxC application so line-continuation characters (\)
# are used to supply the command on multiple lines.  You, however,
# can type the entire command out on a single line.  This
# example places the final results of the VxC application into an
# external file called 'vxc.output.all' and the final mapping
# in to a file called 'vxc.match.all'.  The example uses the
# Cyc input file and manual mapping file found in the supplemental/
# directory.  This example applies all constraints implemented
# by VxC.
#
#    run-vxc /home/verbs/shared/verbnet/release2.0-derek-clean -q \
#        -C supplemental/cyc-rules.txt \
#        -M supplemental/manual-mapping.xml \
#        -F vxc.match.all -Aa > vxc.output.all
#
# Remember that the -C, -M, and -F operators are mandatory.
# For additional information, check the usage note:
#
#    run-vxc -?
