## Run Script ##
################

# This script runs the GroupingUpdater application in the semlink-java project.
#
# This script has a hard-coded path to the compiled code so
# it is meant to point to the shared deployment and symbolic
# links can be used to point to this script.
#
# Here are the two primary uses of this tool, as examples:
# (the first example below just prints a report about the update
# instead of producing the updated files and the second
# example prints a report and produces updated files).
#
#    run-gu ~/svn/verbnet/trunk ~/svn/sense-inventories
#       /usr/local/WordNet-3.0/dict/index.sense
#    run-gu -no ~/svn/verbnet/trunk ~/svn/sense-inventories
#       /usr/local/WordNet-3.0/dict/index.sense ~/my-updated-vn
#
#    -n means a new, updated set of VerbNet XML files are desired
#    -o means overwrite any existing files in my supplied output directory
#
# For additional information, check the usage note:
#
#    run-gu -?
