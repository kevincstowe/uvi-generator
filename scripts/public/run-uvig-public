## Run Script ##
################

# This script runs the UVIG tool.
#
# This script is similar to the 'run-uvig' script, but it has
# specific arguments for re-generating the UVI from the
# most recent VerbNet files.  These files are assumed to be in
#   /home/verbs/shared/verbnet/release-newest
# which is a symbolic link to the directory with the most
# recent VerbNet version.  Furthermore, it is assumed that the
# output directory is .. which it should be if this script
# is still in the generator/ directory under verb-index/.
#
# The word 'public' is used to indicate that this script
# is specific to the installation of the UVI/UVIG on verbs
# in their original locations (verb-index/ and verb-index/generator/).
