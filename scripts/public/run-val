## Run Script ##
################

# This script runs the XMLValidation application in the semlink-java project.
#
# This script has a hard-coded path to the compiled code so
# it is meant to point to the shared deployment and symbolic
# links can be used to point to this script.
#
# You can specify any number of arguments
# to this script.  Each argument is considered an "XML Input Object". An
# XML Input Object is either a file in XML format or a directory containing
# '.xml' files.  Individual files do not have to end in '.xml'.  Here are
# some examples:
#
#    run-val somefile.q
#    run-val myfile.xml yourfile.xml
#    run-val ../verbnet-2.1/
#    run-val myfile.xml ../verbnet-2.1/ yourfile.xml ~/lots-of-xml/ somefile.q
#
# For additional information, check the usage note:
#
#    run-val -?
