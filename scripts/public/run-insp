## Run Script ##
################

# This script runs the VerbNet Inspector application in the semlink-java project.
#
# This script has a hard-coded path to the compiled code so
# it is meant to point to the shared deployment and symbolic
# links can be used to point to this script.
#
# So, for example, you could type the following commands:
# (the first example below is a good representative use
# of this script assuming the symbolic link 'release-newest' is
# still maintained to point to the most recent version of the VerbNet
# XML files - the command just prints everything in VerbNet)
#
#    run-insp /home/verbs/shared/verbnet/release-newest -Vab -i
#    run-insp /home/verbs/shared/verbnet/release2.0-derek-clean -ci
#    run-insp -i -Vfcrxyz ~/my-verbnet-files
#    run-insp -i -Vcq vn2.1 -Ospray
#
# For additional information, check the usage note:
#
#    run-insp -?
