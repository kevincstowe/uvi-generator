## Run Script ##

# This script runs the UVIG tool.
#
# This script has a hard-coded path to the compiled code so
# it is meant to point to the shared deployment and symbolic
# links can be used to point to this script.
#
# For example, you could type the following commands:
# (the first example below is probably the most commonly desired use
# of this script assuming 1) this script and code still reside
# on 'verbs' in their original location so that .. still works correctly
# and 2) the symbolic link 'release-newest' is still maintained
# to point to the most recent version of the VerbNet XML files)
#
#    run-uvig -os /home/verbs/shared/verbnet/release-newest .. supplemental/
#    run-uvig /home/verbs/shared/verbnet/release2.0-derek-clean .. -o -v -s supplemental/
#    run-uvig myXML-dir -goqs newHTML suppldir/

# For additional information, check the usage note:
