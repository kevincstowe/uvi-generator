# This script runs the VxC application.  This script is similar to
# the 'run' script, but it has specific arguments for using files
# specific to the 'verbs' server.  The VerbNet XML files are assumed
# to be in
#   /home/verbs/shared/verbnet/release2.0-derek-clean
# This script places the final results of the VxC application into an
# external file called 'vxc.output.all' and the final mapping
# into a file called 'vxc.match.all'.  The -Sd option is used to 
# send all discards to stderr.  This output is placed into the external
# file called 'vxc.discards.all'.  The script uses the
# Cyc input file and manual mapping file found in the supplemental/
# directory.  This script applies all constraints implemented
# by VxC.
