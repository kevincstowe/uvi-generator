<PRE>Usage: java vn.Inspector [flags] &lt;x> [-V &lt;v>] [-O &lt;o>] -C &lt;c> -M &lt;m> -F &lt;f> [-A &lt;a>] [-S &lt;s>]

NOTE: Command-line elements can occur in any order.  Any element between
      [ ] is optional.  -V, -O, etc. are called "operators".  Space between
      operators and their arguments is optional.  Command-line elements
      are case-sensitive.

Flags:
  -?    Display usage message and exit
  -k    Display key and exit
  -c    Display class hierarchy and exit (-V operator irrelevant)
  -h    Suppress header before output
  -n    Suppress final counts after output
  -m    Include more counts by class (class counts inactive by default)
  -0    Include count categories with a zero count
  -w    Print the name of the current class being processed to stderr
  -s    Sort the members in each class or subclass
  -i    Indent output
  -z    Suppress &lt;NO ...> for subclasses, members, thematic roles and frames
  -q    Force underlying scanning system to operate on verb-frame pairs
        NOTE: This scans the classes in the same manner as -Vq displays them,
        but does not imply printing anything.  Exists so that you can make
        verb-frame pair events fire without printing anything.  If this option
        is specified, -Vm and -Vr imply -Vq if either is supplied. Also,
        -Vq implies -q.
  -v    Invert the order of -q or -Vq so as to visit verb-frame pairs in a
        frame-major order instead of a verb-major order (-q or -Vq required)
  -e    Suppress all events from firing
  -r    Replicate labels that cause additional nesting (file, class, subclass,
        and frame) before each and every line that is printed.  This option is
        provided for increased interoperability with grep.  Grep's -B option
        can be used to show the class and/or frame associated when searching
        for a given pattern in the Inspector's output.

&lt;x>: "VerbNet XML Input Directory"
        Directory where all the VerbNet XML files reside (i.e. care-88.xml).
        Note that the DTD file should also be located in this directory.

&lt;v>: "View Options"
        Control what output is extacted from the XML files and sent to
        the console.  Example: '-Vcv' shows all verbs and the classes or
        subclasses that they belong to.   These are the available options:
            f - file names
            c - class and subclass names
            n - counts (members and frames, -Vc required)
            m - members (i.e. verbs)
            w - WordNet sense tags (-Vm required)
            t - thematic roles
            u - selectional restrictions for thematic roles (-Vt required)
            r - frames
            e - examples
            x - syntax
            y - syntax restrictions for syntax (-Vx required)
            z - selectional restrictions for syntax (-Vx required)
            s - semantics
            a - all above options
            q - verb-frame pairs (implies -Vm, -Vr and -q)
            b - complete XML file content (includes obscure attributes)

&lt;o>: "Only These Files"
        An optional token used to limit the Inspector to a set of VerbNet
        XML files.  This is a comma-delimited list of file names.  However,
        you do not have to specify an entire file name.  You can specify any
        number of characters that you want for each file name.  If an XML file
        begins with the characters of any one of the file names you provided,
        it will be processed.  No space is allowed in &lt;o> token.  Examples:
            -Ochase-51.6.xml - the file chase-51.6.xml
            -O chase-51.6.xml - same as above
            -O chase-51.6 - same as above
            -O chase - same as above (quite useful)
            -O chase-51.6.xml,force-59.xml - both of these files
            -O chase-51.6,force-59 - same as above
            -O chase,force - same as above
            -O chase, force - INVALID - no space allowed
            -O ch,force-59 - all files that begin with a 'ch' and force-59.xml
            -O m,n - all files that begin with an 'm' or an 'n'

&lt;c>: "Cyc Rule File"
        A properly formatted file containing all of the Cyc verbSemTrans
        rules.  The format of this file is the same format as what is produced
        when the 'predicate extent' option is selected for the verbSemTrans
        predicate in the Cyc Knowledge Browser.

&lt;m>: "Manual Mapping File"
        The manual mapping XML file against which to compare Cyc matches.
        Results are printed to stdout after the VerbNet information.

&lt;f>: "Match Output File"
        The file to create in a standard XML format representing all the matches
        made by the automatic matching algorithm.

&lt;a>: "Match Constraints"
        The constraint(s) to use for deciding if a match exists between a VerbNet
        verb-frame pair and a Cyc verbSemTrans rule.  Each is represented by a
        single character.  Can mix-and-match as in this example: '-Atp'.  All
        constraints besides 0 include n automatically.
            0 - Debug Mode: Matches nothing regardless, only used alone
            n - Naive Matching: Matches on lemma (default)
                 (VerbNet Member and Cyc *-TheWord must be equal)
            p - VN must have preposition if Cyc PPCompFrameFn
            t - Transitivity congruence
            i - Infinitive/gerund congruence
            j - Adjective congruence
            f - Cyc fromLocation implies VN Source
            d - Cyc doneBy/performedBy implies VN Agent
            m - Cyc MiddleVoiceFrame implies no VN Agent
            a - enable all constraints (nptijfdm)
        If this operator is not supplied, -An is assumed.  More information
        concerning the constraints can be found in the Javadoc documentation
        for the Cyc and Matcher classes.

&lt;s>: "VxC Application Flags"
        Additional flags for the VxC application.  These are:
            c - Print class match counts
            d - Print a line to stderr for each discarded match
            m - Only look for matches in classes that are covered by the manual
                mapping file; ignore all other classes</PRE>
