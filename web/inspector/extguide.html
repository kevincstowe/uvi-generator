                     There are three ways to extend the Inspector (a.k.a. create custom applications
                     using VerbNet).  The first two simply involve downloading the Inspector application,
                     adding your custom code, and running the new, enhanced Inspector.  The third way
                     pertains more to integrating the Inspector into an existing application and then
                     adding your custom code.
                     For the purposes of displaying the results of your custom code, you can send
                     output to <I>standard out</I> (using <CODE>System.out.println</CODE>), <I>standard error</I>
                     (using <CODE>System.err.println</CODE>), or to an external file (using Java's <CODE>java.io</CODE> package).
                     <BR><BR>
                     <U>Method 1:</U> Good for small- to medium-sized programs.  Download the Inspector
                     application.  In the EventManager class, add code that implements the custom 
                     application directly into the 
                     marked areas for the beginning and end of each event that you need to use.<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide1.jpg" width=542 height=240 alt="Method 1 Example"><BR><BR>
                     Moreover, to improve readability 
                     this code can be in the form of a single method call to another method that you create
                     inside the EventManager class.<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide2.jpg" width=539 height=192 alt="Method 1 Example"><BR><BR>
                     You can add as many methods to this class as you
                     need but they must all be 'static'.<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide3.jpg" width=541 height=125 alt="Method 1 Example"><BR><BR>
                     The method above is shown as 'private' because no method outside of the EventManager
                     class would call it.  The Inspector is then compiled and run according to
                     the details provided in the example scripts.  No further modifications are required.
                     The mock application contained in the Inspector download uses Method 1 for extension.
                     <BR><BR>
                     <U>Method 2:</U> Good for medium- to large-sized applications.  This method is similar to 
                     Method 1 except that no custom methods are added to the EventManager class directly.
                     The majority of the custom code goes into additional files and classes that are added to the same
                     package as and compiled with the rest of the Inspector source code.  Most of the custom
                     code added to the EventManager class is in the form of method calls to other methods
                     in these new classes.<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide4.jpg" width=540 height=193 alt="Method 2 Example"><BR><BR>
                     Make sure each new file contains the line <CODE>package vn;</CODE> at the top of the file.
                     Each file should be placed into the <CODE>src</CODE> directory along with the other
                     three source files.  
                     The methods invoked from the EventManager class must be 'public static' or 'static'.  Here is the
                     file named <CODE>MyAnalyzer.java</CODE>:<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide5.jpg" width=475 height=304 alt="Method 2 Example"><BR><BR>
                     The <CODE>import</CODE> statement allows for quick access to the ArrayList object. 
                     The above file relies on yet another
                     class that exists in its own file called <CODE>ClassSyntaxPair.java</CODE>, shown here:<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide6.jpg" width=216 height=129 alt="Method 2 Example"><BR><BR>
                     So you see, only the methods being invoked from the EventManager class must be 'static'.
                     From there onward, Java's rich object-oriented model can be utilized.  The above code merely creates a
                     list of every frame syntax visited along with the class in which the frame syntax was contained.
                     The VxC application, a VerbNet-Cyc mapper, uses Method 2 for extension.
                     <BR><BR>
                     <U>Method 3:</U> The final method involves integrating the Inspector into 
                     an application of any size.  Such a task could be performed in a variety
                     of ways, depending on the requirements of the environment and the tendencies of
                     the developer.  This method is better suited for more experienced developers.
                     Only the simplest of development environments will be considered here (no attention
                     will be paid to any given IDE's configuration).<BR><BR>
                     Here's the quick technical information about the process.
                     In general, integrating the Inspector into an existing application is the same
                     as using code from a Java package (like <CODE>java.io</CODE>, <CODE>java.util</CODE>,
                     <CODE>javax.swing</CODE>, etc.).  As long as the Java Virtual Machine (i.e. the
                     <CODE>java</CODE> executable) can find these files:
                     <UL>
                        <LI><CODE>vn/EventManager.class</CODE></LI>
                        <LI><CODE>vn/Inspector.class</CODE></LI>
                        <LI><CODE>vn/Sweeper.class</CODE></LI>
                     </UL>
                     then the Inspector is available to invoke.
                     The Java Classpath just needs to include the directory in which the above <CODE>vn</CODE>
                     directory (with the above class files) is contained.  This directory is contained
                     in the Inspector download.  Notice that this does not mean to include
                     the path to the <CODE>vn</CODE> directory itself.  An import statement can then
                     be used in your code (<CODE>import vn.*;</CODE>) or you can fully qualify the invocation
                     of the Inspector as shown below.  Now,
                     here are some easy-to-understand scenarios that might apply to your given situation.<BR><BR>
                     <U>Set-up 1:</U> The simplest possible development environment for your application is to have all your source
                     files and class files in the same directory:
                     <CODE>
                     <UL>
                        <LI>MyApplication/
                           <UL>
                              <LI>MyClass1.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass2.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass3.java</LI>
                           </UL>
                        </LI>
                     </UL>
                     </CODE>
                     In this scenario none of the source files uses a <CODE>package</CODE> statement.
                     If you execute the command<BR><BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;javac *.java</CODE><BR><BR>
                     while in this directory, all the source
                     files are compiled into class files and then you have:
                     <CODE>
                     <UL>
                        <LI>MyApplication/
                           <UL>
                              <LI>MyClass1.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass1.class</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass2.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass2.class</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass3.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass3.class</LI>
                           </UL>
                        </LI>
                     </UL>
                     </CODE>                     
                     This is most likely the current state of your application directory.
                     Now download the Inspector and copy the three <CODE>*.java</CODE>
                     files to the directory that contains the source files for the existing application.
                     Now we have:
                     <CODE>
                     <UL>
                        <LI>MyApplication/
                           <UL>
                              <LI>EventManager.java</LI>
                              <LI>Inspector.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass1.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass1.class</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass2.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass2.class</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass3.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass3.class</LI>
                              <LI>Sweeper.java</LI>
                           </UL>
                        </LI>
                     </UL>
                     </CODE>
                     Now, in order to compile with the Inspector source, it is important to add one option to your compile command:
                     <BR><BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;javac -d . *.java</CODE><BR><BR>
                     The option places the output files (class files) into the current directory (denoted with <CODE>.</CODE>).
                     This option won't affect any of the previous files, but will place the output files of the 
                     Inspector into the proper subdirectory.
                     Executing this command gives:
                     <CODE>
                     <UL>
                        <LI>MyApplication/
                           <UL>
                              <LI>EventManager.java</LI>
                              <LI>Inspector.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass1.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass1.class</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass2.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass2.class</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass3.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass3.class</LI>
                              <LI>Sweeper.java</LI>
                              <LI>vn/
                                 <UL>
                                    <LI>EventManager.class</LI>
                                    <LI>Inspector.class</LI>
                                    <LI>Sweeper.class</LI>
                                 </UL>
                              </LI>
                           </UL>
                        </LI>
                     </UL>
                     </CODE>
                     Your application is now ready to be run.  Assuming the class MyClass1 contains the <CODE>main</CODE>
                     method, executing the command<BR><BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java MyClass1</CODE><BR><BR>will execute your application.
                     However, we haven't hooked up any code yet!  Now that the compilation process has been explained
                     let's look at how we invoke the Inspector from existing code.
                     <BR><BR>
                     When we invoke the Inspector from an existing application, the entire thing runs
                     just as if you were to run the Inspector independently on the command line.  
                     The Inspector prints output and fires events as determined
                     by the command line parameters.  You can invoke the Inspector anywhere in your code.
                     Here is an example in which the Inspector is invoked from a method in an arbitrarily
                     chosen class, MyClass2:<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide7.jpg" width=369 height=304 alt="Method 3 Example"><BR><BR>
                     As you can see, the invocation of the Inspector happens (using the <CODE>run</CODE> method)
                     just as one might invoke the Inspector as a stand-alone application on the command line.
                     The <CODE>import</CODE> statements shown above are for example only, no additional
                     <CODE>import</CODE> statements are required for the Inspector if the above syntax
                     is used to invoke it.<BR><BR>
                     Then, code is added as described in Method 1 or Method 2
                     of this guide.  Only this time, in addition to placing code in the EventManager class
                     or into new files, you can place custom methods into the classes that already exist
                     for the existing application and call them from the EventManager class like so:
                     <BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide8.jpg" width=538 height=272 alt="Method 3 Example"><BR><BR>
                     This provides you with a large amount of flexibility when integrating the Inspector
                     into your application.  The above example also shows an example of parsing the 
                     <CODE>text</CODE> parameter, a common task within the Inspector application framework.
                     As mentioned in the Javadoc documentation, the <CODE>text</CODE> parameter is
                     the exact line of text that the Inspector would show in the normal output mode,
                     but with full view options enabled (-Vab).  The labels for a given event type
                     (class, member, frame, etc.) are guaranteed to have the same format each time
                     an event is fired for that event type.  Therefore, you can rely on the positioning of 
                     parentheses, brackets, braces, spaces, etc. to perform the parsing.  In the
                     example above, the verb is extracted from the member event text by locating
                     the two spaces and taking the text in between them.  This an example of the 
                     event text for the member event type:
                     <BR><BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MEMBER: yelp (wn=yelp%2:32:00)</CODE><BR><BR>
                     The first space will be the one before the verb and the second space will be the one after it.
                     
                     
                     <BR><BR>
                     Now that you've called the Inspector at a given point
                     during the existing application's execution, called custom methods from the
                     EventManager class to be executed when events fire, and implemented
                     the custom methods located in a variety of places, the new enhanced application
                     is ready to compile an run.  Simply execute these two commands in the directory
                     with all the source files:<BR>
                     <BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;javac -d . *.java</CODE>
                     <BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java MyClass1</CODE><BR><BR>
                     
                     <U>Set-up 2:</U> The second type of development environment is very similar to the first
                     except that it assumes you are using one or more packages in your Java source files.
                     The only thing that changes is the file organization and <B>not</B> how you add custom code to the
                     source files. Let's once again assume that your source directory appears as:
                     <CODE>
                     <UL>
                        <LI>MyApplication/
                           <UL>
                              <LI>MyClass1.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass2.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass3.java</LI>
                           </UL>
                        </LI>
                     </UL>
                     </CODE>
                     Let's also assume that the line <CODE>package abc;</CODE> is at the top of
                     every file.  Compiling with the command
                     <BR><BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;javac -d . *.java</CODE><BR><BR>
                     gives:                     
                     <CODE>
                     <UL>
                        <LI>MyApplication/
                           <UL>
                              <LI>MyClass1.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass2.java</LI>
                              <LI>MyClass3.java</LI>
                              <LI>abc/
                                 <UL>
                                    <LI>MyClass1.class</LI>
                                    <LI>MyClass2.class</LI>
                                    <LI>MyClass3.class</LI>
                                 </UL>
                              </LI>

                     </UL>
                     </CODE>
                     When you add the Inspector source files to the source directory and compile
                     again using the same command you have:
                     <CODE>

                     </CODE>
                     Assuming the class MyClass1 still has the <CODE>main</CODE> method for the application,
                     the application is executed from within the <CODE>MyApplication</CODE> directory with the command:
                     <BR><BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java abc.MyClass1</CODE><BR><BR>
                     Notice how since packages are being used the class must be preceded by the package and a period.
                     Now the only thing left to do is to insert the proper code.  Follow the same
                     procedure specified in Set-up 1.  Invoke the Inspector whenever you wish with the 
                     line<BR><BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vn.Inspector.run( &lt;command-line> );</CODE><BR><BR>
                     where <CODE>&lt;command-line></CODE> contains all the arguments for the Inspector application in a 
                     single string, just how they would be supplied on the command line.  Then modify
                     the EventManager class and add the custom code as previously described 
                     and compile and run with<BR>
                     <BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;javac -d . *.java</CODE>
                     <BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java abc.MyClass1</CODE>
                     <BR><BR>
                     <U>Final Notes:</U> Even though using the verb-frame pair mode is optional, both the mock application
                     and VxC take advantage of and require this mode for execution.  Verb-frame pair mode
                     is a way to enumerate and visit every syntactic frame for each verb.
                     It is engaged with the -q option or by using of the <NOBR>-Vq</NOBR> view option. 
                     <BR><BR>
                     Some additional information about extending the Inspector can be found
                     in the Javadoc documentation for the EventManager class and the non-Javadoc comments 
                     in the <CODE>EventManager.java</CODE> source file.
                     <BR><BR>
                     It is also important to note that the Inspector's <CODE>run</CODE> and <CODE>main</CODE>
                     methods do not throw any exceptions.  Any exceptions that reach these two methods
                     are caught and dealt with before the program ends.  Exceptions are usually handled by
                     printing the appropriate messages to standard error.<BR><BR>
                     Finally, if you need to pass additional information to the Inspector so it can perform
                     its custom duties (like a special path from which to extract some data), you can
                     modify any of the source files you need.  The simplest way is to just hard code
                     a value into a new 'static' class variable but you can also add additional command
                     line arguments just as the VxC application has done.  Adding new command line arguments
                     increases usability for the developer and all additional users (so that it is not required
                     to recompile the code each time you need to change a supplemental piece of data).  The following
                     explains the process for adding a new command line argument to the Inspector.
                     <BR><BR>
                     A command line argument will be most easily implemented by adding a new "operator"
                     whose argument will be your new command line argument.  Consider we want to add a new
                     path that the Inspector uses to extract data from.  Let's call this the path to the <I>x-ray</I>
                     file, just for argument's sake.  Thus, we want to be able to supply this path on the command line
                     like so:<BR>
                     <BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java vn.Inspector -qs ../vn-xml -Ospray -X ~/x-ray.file</CODE><BR><BR>
                     The new operator is -X and its argument for this execution is <CODE>~/x-ray.file</CODE>.  To implement
                     this new operator, first add a 'public static' or 'static' class variable to any class really,
                     either the EventManager class or a custom class (the following examples are just a few lines of each class):<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide9.jpg" width=199 height=61 alt="Adding an Operator"><BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide10.jpg" width=201 height=62 alt="Adding an Operator"><BR><BR>
                     This will be the variable that we use for the new path (which you can access from anywhere in 
                     your application since it is accessible to all classes in the package).  Then you just
                     modify the Inspector class to recognize the new operator on the command line and set the above
                     variable.  To do this we first add the operator symbol to the list of all operators.  So the line<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide11.jpg" width=368 height=30 alt="Adding an Operator"><BR><BR>
                     becomes<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide12.jpg" width=373 height=28 alt="Adding an Operator"><BR><BR>
                     Then modify the usage message so users of your application know what the new operator is about. 
                     Change the main usage line to<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide13.jpg" width=542 height=29 alt="Adding an Operator"><BR><BR>
                     and add the proper description of the new operator argument:<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide14.jpg" width=476 height=60 alt="Adding an Operator"><BR><BR>
                     If the operator were optional, we'd include brackets around it (<CODE>[-X &lt;x>]</CODE>).  Finally
                     we modify the <CODE>analyzeArguments</CODE> method to accept the operator and set
                     the proper variable.  Add code to set the new variable after the <I>only-these-files</I>
                     operator's case, like so:<BR><BR>
                     <IMG src="images/extguide15.jpg" width=440 height=320 alt="Adding an Operator"><BR><BR>
                     The variable <CODE>buddy</CODE> is used to hold the token right next to the current
                     operator being processed.  Then we're done!  The Inspector application 
                     correctly recognizes the new operator and sets the appropriate variable
                     (replace <CODE>EventManager</CODE> with the name of whatever class houses the new variable). If you
                     want to perform some additional error checking on a path variable (like <CODE>xRayPath</CODE>), look at the
                     code later on in <CODE>analyzeArguments</CODE> that checks the validity of the
                     XML input directory (stored in the variable <CODE>vnDir</CODE>).  This code is similar to how
                     you would validate a path parameter supplied on the command line.  But in general, you can
                     check your new command line arguments for errors after the main loop in <CODE>analyzeArguments</CODE>
                     has completed.
