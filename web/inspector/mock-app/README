the events fire regardless of view options

the counts represent outputted labels only (nothing to do with event-firing)

      println( "        NOTE: This scans the files in the same manner as -Vq displays them," );
      println( "        but does not imply printing anything.  Exists so that you can make" );
      println( "        verb-frame pair events fire without printing anything.  If this option" );
      println( "        is specified, -Vm and -Vr imply -Vq if either is supplied." );

important to note that end class and end subclass don't fire until they are
completely done, not just after their endframes event, they maybe include other
subclasses before exiting

ask about licensing (both inspector and uvig)

describe or include compile and run scripts

MAYBE OPTIONS:
  -? prevent spaces in syntax tokens: in case you want to
  parse the syntax line your self, this option suppresses spaces within a single
  element so that it is easy and correct to use the Java split() method to chunk
  the syntax line into its constituent parts very easily.

when combined with grep...even more powerful
