the events fire regardless of view options

the counts represent outputted labels only (nothing to do with event-firing)

      println( "        NOTE: This scans the files in the same manner as -Vq displays them," );
      println( "        but does not imply printing anything.  Exists so that you can make" );
      println( "        verb-frame pair events fire without printing anything.  If this option" );
      println( "        is specified, -Vm and -Vr imply -Vq if either is supplied." );

important to note that end class and end subclass don't fire until they are
completely done, not just after their endframes event, they maybe include other
subclasses before exiting

talk about example UNIX scripts and how they relate to windows


when combined with grep...even more powerful
