Participant: Entity involved in a state or event.
Example: JOHN sighed.
//
Actor: Participant that is the instigator of an event.
Example: JENNIFER baked the potatoes. 
//
Cause: Actor in an event (that may be animate or inanimate) that initiates the event, but that does not act with any intentionality or consciousness; it exists independently of the event.
Example: RACIAL INEQUALITY engenders conflict. 
//
Agent: Actor in an event who initiates and carries out the event intentionally or consciously, and who exists independently of the event.
Example: THEY decided to go. 
//
Co-Agent: Agent who is acting in coordination or reciprocally with another agent while participating in the same event (specific to events with symmetrical participants).
Example: Susan chitchatted WITH RACHEL. 
//
Stimulus: Cause in an event that elicits an emotional or psychological response (specific to events of perception). 
Example: THE PEA SOUP tasted delicious.  
//
Undergoer: Participant in a state or event that is not an instigator of the event or state.
Example: HE died of illness. 
//
Instrument: Undergoer in an event that is manipulated by an agent, and with which an intentional act is performed; it exists independently of the event. For all roles containing symmetrical participants, we assume that the ordering is non-arbitrary and may be pragmatically determined and/or related to figure-ground considerations; however, the usefulness of this distinction may be application-specific.
Example: Jennifer baked the potatoes IN THE OVEN.  
//
Theme: Undergoer that is central to an event or state that does not have control over the way the event occurs, is not structurally changed by the event, and/or is characterized as being in a certain position or condition throughout the state.
Example: THE BALL rolled down the hill. 
//
Co-Theme: Theme that participates in an event or state with another Theme; both participate equally (thereby distinguishing this role from Pivot; specific to events with symmetrical participants).
Example: Italy borders FRANCE.  
//
Pivot: Theme that participates in an event with another theme unequally. Pivot is much more central to the event (thereby distinguishing it from Co-Theme).
Example: THE RANCHER owns twelve oxen. 
//
Topic: Theme characterized by information content transferred to another participant (specific to events of communication).
Example: Susan chitchatted with Rachel ABOUT THE PROBLEM.
//
Patient: Undergoer in an event that is usually structurally changed, for instance by experiencing a change of state, location or condition, is often acted upon by an agent, that is causally involved or directly affected by other participants, and exists independently of the event.
Example: Brutus murdered JULIUS CAESAR. 
//
Co-Patient: Patient that participates in an event with another patient, both participate equally in the event (specific to events with symmetrical participants).
Example: The twig broke off THE BRANCH. 
//
Experiencer: Patient that is aware of the event undergone, which often involves an emotional or psychological response elicited by a Stimulus 
(specific to events of perception). 
Example: THE CHILDREN tasted the pea soup.
//
Attribute: Undergoer that is a property of an entity or entities, as opposed to the entity itself.
//
Beneficiary: Undergoer in a state or an event that is (potentially) advantaged or disadvantaged by the event or state.
Example: Martha carved a toy FOR THE BABY. 
//
Circumstance:  The setting or backdrop of another event or state.
Example: He joined the board AS CFO. 
//
Predicate:  An event or state that is secondary to the main event, represented by the matrix verb. 
//
Manner:  Way or style of performing an action, or the degree/strength of a cognitive or emotional state.
Example: We lived ON $10 PER DAY. 
//
Attribute: Circumstance that is a property of an entity or entities, as opposed to the entity itself.
Example: Oil increased IN PRICE. 
//
Place: Participant that represents the state in which an entity exists.
Example: The belt came UNDONE. 
//
Location: Place that is concrete. 
Example: Herbicides persist IN THE SOIL. 
//
Source: Place that is the starting point of action; exists independently of the event.
Example: I gleaned FROM THE EVIDENCE how she did it. 
//
Material: Patient that exists at the starting point of action (inheritance from Source), which is transformed through the event into a new entity; concrete or abstract.
Example: An oak tree will grow FROM THAT ACORN. 
//
Initial_Location: Source that indicates the concrete, physical location where an event begins or a state becomes true.
Example: Amanda drove the package FROM HOME. 
//
Initial_State:	Source that indicates the state in which an entity begins.
Example: Need an example
//	
Goal: Place that is the end point of an action and exists independently of the event.
Example: She classified the articles INTO DIFFERENT GENRES. 
//
Destination: Goal that is a concrete, physical location. 
Example: Tamara poured water INTO THE BOWL. 
//
Recipient: Destination that is animate. 
Example: They lent a bicycle TO ME. 
//
Result: Goal that comes into existence through the event. 
Example: He strangled his victims TO DEATH. 
//
Product: Result that is a concrete object.
Example: AN OAK TREE will grow from that acorn.  
//
Path: Path is the ‘region’ the motion traverses; the connecting region between the source and goal (both concrete and abstract) locations.
Example: She reached her hand OUT. 
//
Trajectory: Trajectory refers to the path or the 'region' the motion traverses when the motion event expresses a change of location.
Example: He came THROUGH THE DOOR. 
//
Extent: Value indicating the amount of measurable change to a participant over the course of the event. 
Example: She exceeded him in speed BY TWO MILES PER HOUR.
//
Time: Participant that indicates an instant or an interval of time during which a state exists or an event took place.
Example: The party begins AT 6 PM.
//
Initial_Time: Time that indicates when an event begins or a state becomes true (i.e. the beginning point of the state).
Example: The party continued FROM 6 PM. 
//
Final_Time: Time that indicates when an event ends or a state becomes false (i.e. the ending point of the state).
Example: The party continued UNTIL 8 PM.
//
Frequency: Number of occurrences of an event within a given time span.
Example: The postman always rings TWICE. 
//
Duration: Length or extent of time.
Example: The party continued FOR TWO HOURS.
//
Value: Place along a formal scale.
Example: He put the probability AT 0.9.
//
Extent: Value indicating the amount of measurable change to a participant over the course of the event. 
//
Asset: Value that is a concrete object.
