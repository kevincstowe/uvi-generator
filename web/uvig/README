===== Unified Verb Index Generator (UVIG) README =====
======================================================

* This document explains how to use the UVIG.
* This document gives tips on how to modify the UVIG.
* This document describes the data sources that comprise the UVI.

to be completed eventually.....  DT

note in here somewhere:   doesn't make sense to release this code for public consumption.  The Inspector yes, but not the UVIG.
reason for orig- directory

what to change if the format of one of the external file changes.

  JUMP START: If you are only reading this README to generate new HTML files
  from updated VerbNet XML files or other sources, this command may prove
  helpful.  It is an example of what you might execute.  Replace paths and
  flags for your situation (these two lines are part of one command):

    java UVI.Generator -oqs /home/verbs/shared/verbnet/release-newest
                /home/verbs/shared/public_html/verb-index
  -or-
    run -oqs /home/verbs/shared/verbnet/release-newest ..
    (when using script in /home/verbs/shared/public_html/verb-index/generator)
  -or-
    run-public
    (when using script in /home/verbs/shared/public_html/verb-index/generator)

add comments to this list?

TALK ABOUT all-comments-copy.backup
talk about how comments entry is both HTML and simple text supportive, so there is a conflict with how the carriage returns are represented.  hard to ask the user to insert ehri own breaks and hard to not insert hte breaks for them for simple text (edward's UL problem)

Chapter 1: Usage and Flags
--------------------------
how to use, execute
flags/usage
 compile script available
 run script available

/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_08/jre/lib/rt.jar
javac -d . -classpath /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_08/jre/lib/rt.jar src/*

should probably create gop and goc for them cause of this RT issue

Chapter 2: User Guide
---------------------
what the * means

Chapter 3: Supplemental Files
-----------------------------
what files should be present
explanation of the suppl files, what you can do with them
format of the suppl files

you can always provide updated information by placing the new file (of the same format)
into the supplemental directory with the correct file name, and re-running the output
tool.  Re-running the tool does not erase user lists or comments - it just reconstructs
the web pages with the updated data sources.

originals are in originals-Sept-2006

so you can revert back to them if something happens

all have .s extension



Chapter 4: Error-Checking
-------------------------
how much idiot proofing there is
the kind of error checking that takes place on the XML files
that there should be a DTD located in the directory. (and how the tool will handle lack thereof)
   all errors to stderror (and include in README that's where it's going)
   all the different types of errors that it catches (and what it won't catch, aka what it doesn't know to look for)


Chapter 5: Data Sources
-----------------------

propbank.s is CSV  verb,url

a change to the format of one of these files could require a change in the java code

Original name for vn-fn.s is VNclass-FNframeMappings.xml.  8/28/06  no changes necessary to the file
  docroot verbnet-framenet_MappingData
  DS and NA are ignored

framenet verbLexEntries.xml, docroot framenet1.2_verbLexEntries
I added a DTD specification inside the file:
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <!DOCTYPE framenet1.2_verbLexEntries  [
        <!ELEMENT framenet1.2_verbLexEntries (lexical-entry+)>
        <!ELEMENT lexical-entry   (#PCDATA)>

        <!ATTLIST lexical-entry ID CDATA #REQUIRED>
        <!ATTLIST lexical-entry name CDATA #REQUIRED>
        <!ATTLIST lexical-entry frame CDATA #REQUIRED>
        <!ATTLIST lexical-entry pos CDATA #REQUIRED>
        <!ATTLIST lexical-entry incorporatedFE CDATA #REQUIRED>
      ]>
AND I HAD TO CLOSE each lexial-entry node by adding /> at the end instead of just > (so it passes the parser).  All TEST's were removed.

PropBank

If you take the current index HTML files in the current UVI, you get 3313 total PropBank links/verbs.
But then you delete 'breath' cause it's not a verb.  so you have 3312 verbs in the current UVI. Call this file A

Then you go to the current ..../framesets/ directory on verbs' web server. you do an ls -l > xx
you delete the first line
you delete all files that have 0 size (*hopefully* these are the only configuration files, since all files
regardless of their meaning have a -v on them)
this gives you 3633 HTML verb files  call this file B

you can transform this file into a file of the form:
  verb,http://verbs.colorado.edu/framesets/verb-v.html

do the same with the file A
sort them both just in case - IMPORTANT STEP
then do a diff

 Lines in fs.ready-index.sorted: 3633
 Lines in uvi.ready-index.sorted: 3312
 Identical lines: 3312
 Lines in fs.ready-index.sorted not in uvi.ready-index.sorted: 321
 Lines in uvi.ready-index.sorted not in fs.ready-index.sorted: 0
 Percent of lines fs.ready-index.sorted in uvi.ready-index.sorted: 91.16%
 Percent of lines uvi.ready-index.sorted in fs.ready-index.sorted: 100.00%

The prognosis is good, the current frameset files do indeed have all the original propbank files and more.

the file fs.ready-index.sorted was copied into propbank.s on 2006.8.26 at 18:43.  this will be the input for the
initial set of HTML files for the new UVI.

Chapter 7: Developer
--------------------

 - reason for so much staticness
 - how to recompile
 - how to make changes
 - how to regen the javadoc
 compile script available
 run script available

 include the javadoc scripts to regenerate the jd html pages, explain what each option does
 cp src/*.java UVI
javadoc -author -version -linkoffline http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api -d javadoc -private UVI

 create 'create-javadoc' script in generator/ directory??

importance of:
chgrp -R www *
 everything is group www so all in that group can access and change th efiles.
chmod -R g+w *
 anytime you add a file to this directory, good to give the www group write rights

 - what code to change if the format of a supplemental file has changed.

CSS

 show actual, not just super class, could be listed twice on the index

how to view the javadoc for the java program

all files in the supplemental directory tree are put into a single directory (without subdirectories)
 so if you have a x.jpg in supplemental/ and an x.jpg in supplemental/images/, there will be a conflict.
